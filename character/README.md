# Character Queries – GraphQL

This project demonstrates how to query characters from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API.

## Endpoint
https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

## Queries
We fetch characters with IDs `1, 2, 3, 4` and return:
- `id`
- `name`
- `status`
- `species`
- `type`
- `gender`

## Files
- `character-id-1.graphql` → query for character 1
- `character-id-1-output.json` → result for character 1
- `character-id-2.graphql` → query for character 2
- `character-id-2-output.json` → result for character 2
- `character-id-3.graphql` → query for character 3
- `character-id-3-output.json` → result for character 3
- `character-id-4.graphql` → query for character 4
- `character-id-4-output.json` → result for character 4
